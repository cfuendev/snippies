### chatgpt-sidebar-toggle

Adds a little button that peeks out of ChatGPT's taskbar which toggles the task bar.

### svelte-repl-dark.js

Adds a Dark Mode toggle button to Svelte's official online REPL.

**NOTE:**
Still a work in progress, although mostly a very aesthetically pleasing dark theme, it still has some places where it needs improvement, such as the 'generated code' sections.
