### chatgpt-sidebar-toggle

Adds a little button that peeks out of ChatGPT's taskbar which toggles the task bar.

**NOTE:**
This is a broken userscript which needs some improvement to achieve perfection, at least aesthetically. It has no animations/transitions or anything fancy right now and since the MutationObserver implementation to avoid client-side routing from making the button vanish was rushed and poorly programmed (Because I recorded myself while doing it and I was nervous), the button's appearance tends to break quickly, despite never ceasing to work properly.

### svelte-repl-dark.js

Adds a Dark Mode toggle button to Svelte's official online REPL.

**NOTE:**
Still a work in progress, although mostly a very aesthetically pleasing dark theme, it still has some places where it needs improvement, such as the 'generated code' sections.
