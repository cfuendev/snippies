# snippies
Helpers, wrappers, userscripts and code in general that WILL be useful in the future

### Categories

**Scripts**
Full fledged programs designed as drop-in to perform specific tasks.

**Userscripts**
Userscripts are scripts that are typically executed by web browsers to modify the behavior or appearance of websites. They need to be loaded by script-injecting extensions like Tampermonkey (Or via the browser's own script-injection capabilities, something that both [Min](https://github.com/minbrowser/min) and [Via](https://github.com/tuyafeng/Via) Browsers have)

**Utils**
Small utility libraries that could potentially be standalone npm packages. These libraries are meant to be downloaded and imported into projects or can be imported via HTTP imports, particularly in the case of Deno.

**Snippets**
Pieces of code that either serve as references or can be directly implemented for specific functionalities after a bit of re-writing. They are not standalone utilities, as they may require further configuration or integration into existing programs. These snippets can be used as building blocks or as examples for implementing specific features.

Feel free to explore the Snippies collection, leverage the resources, and customize them to suit your specific needs. They're divided in folders which represent the different categories, so if you're looking for documentation open any of the folders and read the README.md file in it.
